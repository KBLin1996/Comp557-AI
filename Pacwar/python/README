# For this project, the main code is in GA.py.
# You can simply execute "python GA.py" to evolve the gene
# You can also change the gene you want to evolve in the main function,
# and adjust the parameters based on your own preference.

# After execution, the code will automatically generate a directory called
# "Genes/" to store all of the evolution genes in each turn.



# This is an example PacWar python interface for comp557.
#
# Build tools for c++ should be installed on your computer. 
# For example:
#     - On a Mac, make sure you have xcode installed 
#               (xcode-select install on the command prompt)
#     - On windows, make sure you have Visual Studio installed
#
# Also note that this interface needs NumPy.
#
# To run the example code, 
#     1. delete "_PyPacwar" library with the file extension
#        .so (Mac/Linux) or .pyd (Windows) if exist
#
#     2. build the CPython extension with the following command:
#		python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#
#        you can ignore "Using deprecated NumPy API" warning.
#        this will create "_PyPacwar" library.
#
#     3. run the example code with the following command:
# 		python PyPacwarExample.py
#
